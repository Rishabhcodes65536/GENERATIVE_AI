### Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion Models

**Author: [Rishabh Jain]**

Welcome to the repository for learning materials on Generative AI. This repository covers various topics aimed at understanding and implementing advanced generative techniques.This repository is compiled from various sources intended for learning Generative Ai for beginners like me.
*I'll try to constantly update the repository with the new things i learn during the journey*

#### Note on AI Accuracy

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimentation with generative AI models. While models and techniques may evolve, the fundamentals taught here remain foundational. No copyright infringement is intended for images used in this repository.Some of the ouputs may not be deterministic although i have tried to set seed for deterministic results.



#### Getting Started

To get started with any of the topics above, navigate to the respective folder and explore the README files and Jupyter notebooks provided. Each folder contains detailed instructions, code examples, and resources to help you understand and implement generative AI techniques effectively.
